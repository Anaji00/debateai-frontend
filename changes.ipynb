        "Authentication is cookie-based. This means once you log in, the browser stores a special cookie that it sends with every subsequent request to the backend, proving who you are.\n",

        "2.  **Initial Load:** When the app first loads, `AuthProvider`'s `useEffect` hook runs. It calls the `refresh()` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Checking the Session (`refresh()`):** The `refresh` function calls `getMe()` from `auth/api.ts`. This sends a request to the `/auth/me` endpoint on the backend. Because our API calls use `credentials: 'include'`, the browser automatically sends the session cookie if it exists.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Backend Response:**\n",
        "    *   If the cookie is valid, the backend returns the user's data.\n",
        "    *   If there's no cookie or it's invalid, the backend returns an error (like 401 Unauthorized).\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **State Update:** `AuthProvider` updates its state based on the response. If user data comes back, `isAuthenticated` becomes `true`. If not, it becomes `false`. The `isLoading` state is set to `false` once this check is complete.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Guarding Routes (`ProtectedRoute.tsx`):** When you try to access a page like `/debate`, the `ProtectedRoute` component checks the `isAuthenticated` and `isLoading` flags from `useAuth()`.\n",
        "    *   If `isLoading`, it shows a loading message.\n",
        "    *   If not `isAuthenticated`, it redirects you to `/login`.\n",

        "\n",
        "The most complex part of `useDebate` is handling the real-time data stream.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Initiating the Stream:** When `start()` or `send()` is called, it uses a function from `debateClient.ts` (e.g., `versusStartStream`). This function makes a `fetch` request but, crucially, passes an `onEvent` callback function.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **The `onEvent` Callback:** This function lives inside `useDebate`. It's the designated handler for all events that come from the server for a specific debate.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **The `switch` Statement:** The `onEvent` function uses a `switch` statement to handle different event types (`session`, `turn`, `delta`, `endturn`).\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   `case 'turn'`: A new character is about to speak. The hook adds a new, empty message bubble to the `messages` array and sets `typingSpeaker` to show the typing indicator.\n",
        "    *   `case 'delta'`: A small piece of text (a \"delta\") has arrived for the current turn. The hook finds the corresponding message in the `messages` array and appends the delta to its text.\n",
        "    *   `case 'endturn'`: The character has finished speaking. The hook sets `typingSpeaker` to `null` to hide the indicator.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**The Goal:** When a character starts talking, we want a small delay before the first words appear, so the user has time to see who is talking. But we don't want to lose any text that arrives during that delay.\n",

        "**The Code (`appendDelta` function in `useDebate.ts`):**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Is this the first text for this turn?** It checks a `Set` called `firstDeltaSeenRef` to see if we've already shown text for this turn.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **If YES (it's the first):**\n",
        "    *   It doesn't show the text immediately. Instead, it stores the text in a temporary `initialDeltaBufferRef`.\n",
        "    *   It starts a `setTimeout` for `250ms`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **While the timer is ticking:** If more text arrives for the same turn, it just keeps adding it to the buffer.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **When the timer finishes:**\n",
        "    *   It takes everything that's in the buffer and appends it to the message bubble all at once.\n",
        "    *   **Crucially, it now marks the turn as \"seen\"** in `firstDeltaSeenRef`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **If NO (it's not the first text):** It just appends the text to the message bubble immediately, because the initial delay is over.\n",

        "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Conditional Styling:** The component dynamically changes its appearance based on the `isSelected` and `disabled` props. This is done using ternary operators inside the `className` array.\n",
        "- **Group Hover:** Tailwind's `group` feature is used to show child elements (like the character's name and quote) when the parent button is hovered over. This is a very powerful feature that keeps the logic within the component.\n",
        "- **Animation with Framer Motion:** The component uses the `motion` library to add subtle animations, like scaling on tap (`whileTap`) and fading in the text (`initial`, `animate`). This adds a layer of polish to the user experience.\n"
